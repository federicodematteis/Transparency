All this script and other scripts at 

https://github.com/federicodematteis/ECAL-work

A list of the scripts in this folder:

-regression_num.py/ipynb: actual code for DNN regressions for crystals data from iRings 22...28
-TurnOnCurve version for single fills (the code for the turn on is also inside some regression.py scripts)

Other scripts :
-EE2DFitting, Fitsinglefill_2D, Tiring/Tiring-save : scripts for fitting single fills in a crystal, starting from the work of Alessandro Brumasolino.

-Scripts for plotting: Correlation, datavisualization, fillgenerator, smoothing

-Data: for running the scripts in this folder -npy files and fill_metadata_2017.csv


In the image folder

-Transparency fit for single fills --> FIT
-Transparency predictions for an entire run, for a single iRing(crystal) --> DNN
-Transparency predictions for different fills of a single iRing, using various iRings for the training dataset. --> DNN
-some data visualization and a plot of the network

In the folder Interpretability: omology.py for data-dimensionality reduction (not important)

last updates

-Transparency predictions over different fills using a single DNN for every fill of validationcan be found at the gdoc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rJgVz8wP1b-NAR73MX_-O5J5WLQosRoqzqC0d5xuioQ/edit?usp=sharing
